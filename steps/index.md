# The Steps for solving programming problems

## Analyzing the problem

**Step 1. Solve instances by hand**

Find...

**Step 2. Write down your steps**


**Step 3. Propose a general solution**


**Step 4. Test the algorithm**

Now you can try to verify that your algorithm is correct. Take a few test cases and very carefully trace the steps. To ensure that steps aren't **ambiguous**, you might want to have someone else test the steps for you.

## Implementing the solution

**Step 5. Translate to code**

**Step 6. Test the program**

**Step 7. Debug the program**

Have you found an apparent problem with the program? Then you should find out what is going on, either tracing it back to a **bug** in your implementation, or a more fundamental problem in the steps of your algorithm.


## Reviewing the code
