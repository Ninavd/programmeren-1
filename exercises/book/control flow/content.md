# Exercises: Control Flow

Watch these videos for an introduction to conditionals and loops. These are the two most important concepts you'll encounter, and both will be part of all programs that you will be writing (and reading!).

## Conditionals

## Practice exercises

Take your Programming Basics book and do **all exercises** from chapters 4, 5 and 6. It's important to do the exercises by hand (on paper), without using a calculator. When done like that, you'll develop a little bit of intuition about the basic calculations that are part of many computer programs. You will need it for the next module.

If you already have some experience with calculations in programming languages, be sure to do the last few exercises of every page and check if what you think is the answer is indeed correct! All answers are in the back of the book.

After completing your practice exercises you will take an online test. We intend you to make it without errors. When you fail the online test (it has 13 questions), you can simply take it again. If you have any questions, just drop the question in the forums and discuss!

> One particular point of the tests is that you can infer the **data type** of the outcome of an expression. Especially take care of writing `5.0` (with a decimal point) when the answer is a floating-point number, and writing `5` if the answer is an integer.

## How to submit

When done with the test, take a screenshot of the results screen. You can attach it below; it will be uploaded together with your answers to the questions.
