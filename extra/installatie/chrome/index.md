# Chromebook: Installing

To develop with a C compiler you will need some tools on your Chromebook. This guide helps you to install these tools and a code editor.

## Step 1: The Linux environment

First, head on over to the Settings app. Then in the sidebar, click advanced, then developers. From there install the Linux environment.

## Step 2: Tools

After the installation has completed, open the "Terminal" application on your chromebook. Then enter the following line:

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uvapl/installer/main/run.sh)"

This is a script that will guide you through most of the installation. Whenever you get error messages that you don't understand, please contact the course's staff for help.

## Step 3: Atom

Download the `.deb` file from [Atom](https://atom.io/). Find the downloaded in the downloads folder, double click it and install on Linux.
