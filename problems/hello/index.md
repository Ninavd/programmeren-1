# Hello, you!

Here's your first C program:

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void)
    {
        printf("hello, world\n");
    }

In your editor, create a file called `hello.c` and save it in the `Programming` directory. Add the code from above and save again. Now open your terminal and navigate to the same directory (the first line is for macOS, the second for Windows):

    cd ~/Documents/Programming/
    cd /mnt/c/Users/<Windows User Name>/Documents/Programming/

Now make your program and run it. The first command should not give any errors, but if it does, discuss with your peers and ask for help.

    make hello
    ./hello

Does the program print the message correctly? Nice.

## Adding functionality

No matter how you compile or execute the program, it only ever prints `hello, world`. Let's personalize it a bit, just as we did in lecture.

Modify this program in such a way that it first prompts the user for their name and then prints `hello, so-and-so`, where `so-and-so` is their actual name.
