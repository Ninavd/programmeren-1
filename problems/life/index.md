# Game of Life

Implement a command-line application of the Game of Life in C, utilizing ANSI escape codes for animation. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway, where cells evolve through simple rules.

When starting the application, it should start with an "interesting" configuration that is then animated according to the rules of the game of life.
