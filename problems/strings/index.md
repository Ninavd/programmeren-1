# Strings

Implement the functions below in a file called `strings.c`

## Vertical

    t
    o
    k
    y
    o

    h
    o
    t
    e
    l

Start like this:

    void vertical(string input)
    {
        
    }

    Get it!

## Eek

Write a function `eek` that takes a string and tells you how many e's that string contains. For instance, `eek("Eek a mouse!")` should print:
