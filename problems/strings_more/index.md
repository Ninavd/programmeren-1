# strings more

Implement the functions below in a file called `strings_more.c`

## emordnilaPalindrome

Write a function `is_palindrome` that takes a string and returns true if it is a palindrome (a word that is the same spelled backwards), false otherwise. Spaces and other non-alphabetic characters must be ignored. For instance, `is_palindrome("Never odd or even!")` should return `true`.

## Taboo

Using the word 'cat' is taboo. Write a function `taboo` that takes in a string and prints that string with each occurance of the word 'cat' replaced with 'dog'. Even better, 'Cat' becomes 'Dog', with casing left intact! For instance, `taboo("The Cheshire Cat is the cat of the Duchess.")` should print:

    The Cheshire Dog is the dog of the Duchess.
