# Code review: Calendar

Learning to assess your own code, and finding ways to improve it, is an important part of learning to program. For each module, you will do a code review with one or more other students. In the code review, you will give each other feedback and advice on improving your code.

In order to keep the task within reasonable limits, for each module we will provide a number of **aspects** that you should consider during the review. These are also the aspects that your programs will be *primarily* graded on by the staff.

> Warning: do not start code review until you **and** your partner are completely done and have submitted working versions of each program in the module. If you haven't finished your programs you should ask for help on that specifically and never look at someone else's code.
> Additionaly, your mentor should assign a partner for you: each week, it will be a **different** one. This is make sure that you encounter as many insights as possible about writing good code.

## What to do

For this module, you will assess and improve your code along the following aspects. Take your time to fully read and grasp the descriptions there before you contact your partner.

Now take these steps (click for instructions):

1.  [Perform a review of your partner's code.](/modules/m3/review) (separately, 10 minutes)
2.  [Share and discuss your feedback and create a plan to revise your code.](/modules/m3/todo) (together, 10 minutes each)
3.  [Revise your solution and upload the final version.](/modules/m3/revised) (separately, 30 minutes)
4.  Later, receive feedback from your mentor to learn even more.
