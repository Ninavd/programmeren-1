# Review

Exchange your solutions with your assigned partner. You can also exchange laptops and take 10 minutes (without discussing) to study the code and write down some feedback.

1.  Connect to your partner. Enter their name here:

    <input name="form[partner]" type="text" required>

2.  Exchange solutions files or simply switch laptops with your assigned partner.

3.  Take your partner's code and review it using the aspects (remember which ones?). What is missing? How can the code get even better? Note specific examples and line numbers if needed.

    <textarea name="form[review]" rows="8" required></textarea>

4.  Copy-paste your feedback and save it for the next step. Then submit your feedback here and contact your partner.
