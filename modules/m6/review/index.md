# Review

To get started you will go over your partner's code and think of ways to improve it, especially with regards to the aspects that are used this week.

1.  Connect to your assigned partner. Enter their name here:

    <input name="form[partner]" type="text" required>

2.  Exchange solutions files or simply switch laptops with your partner.

3.  Take your partner's code and review it using the aspects (remember which ones?). What is missing? How can the code get even better? Note specific examples and line numbers if needed.

    <textarea name="form[review]" rows="8" required></textarea>

4.  Copy-paste your feedback and save it for the next step. Then press the submit button, below, and contact your partner.
