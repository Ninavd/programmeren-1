# Module 1: C

In this module, you'll learn about the C programming language. It's a great language that has been used to make small and large programs alike. You'll start with the small ones!

## Getting Started

The goal of this exercise is to try out compiling your program, maybe fixing a typo and getting used to the editor. No need to submit!

- Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/join){:.external}

- Write your first program: [Hello](https://lab.cs50.io/uva/cs50x/master/problems/hello/){:.external}


## What to Do

### 1. Preparation

You'll create an instance of the CS50 IDE, which will be your "code editor" for the weeks coming. The goal is to write a very small program from scratch and learning to test your program using `check50`. (Note that the IDE currently only works in Chrome and Firefox!)

- Login to the [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/){:.external} using your GitHub account

- Learn about using the [Command Line](/shorts/command-line) in the IDE

- Create a "`module1`" directory in the IDE as by `mkdir ~/module1` and `cd` into it

- Implement [Water](/problems/water) and immediately submit it when done!

### 2. Problems

After implementing water, your main task of the week is to implement and submit these two problems:

- [Greedy](/problems/greedy)

- [Mario](/problems/mario-less)

Do not forget to submit your solutions on the problem pages. If `check50` is happy, you should submit them! However, before submitting, always keep in mind the course's policy on [academic honesty](/syllabus#samenwerken-fraude-en-plagiaat) (plagiarism!).

### 3. Hacker problems

If you are quick to finish the previous two problems, and you have ample time left before the deadline, have a go at solving the "Hacker" problems. These are often substantially harder than the standard problems.

Solving and submitting the hacker problems in addition to the standard problems may earn you 1 extra point for this module. However, you must submit all problems before the original deadline to be eligible for this point.

- [Mario](/problems/mario-more), the hacker edition, a little bit harder than Mario

- [Credit](/problems/credit), a problem that is quite hard to solve

### 4. Test

At the appointed times, you should take these tests:

- [Variables](/exercises/variables)

### 5. Code review

1. As soon as you have submitted working solutions for all problems, you should take time to improve on the "quality" of your programs. For this module, we only look at the following four criteria, which you might have seen mentioned in the lectures:

    - [Comments](/quality/comments)
    - [Naming](/quality/naming)
    - [Indenting code](/quality/indentation)
    - [Whitespace](/quality/whitespace)

2. Don't forget to use `style50` to automatically suggest corrections for indentation and whitespace! However, `style50` is a very simple tool, so do not depend on it too much. And feel free to ignore the suggestions if you feel your code's layout is more consistent like it is.

3. Then, you should find a partner to do code reviews with. You will review their code on the criteria above, and they will review your code.

4. Then, you should submit the problems again. Your mentor will assess your programs, assign a grade for quality, and provide you with some written feedback. The feedback will never be "everything" that can be improved, but a small sample. When you receive it, compare it to the ideas that you got during your own code review, and think how you could improve on the review next time.
